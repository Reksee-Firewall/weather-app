  || Introdução

  - A weather forecast site using the Visual Crossing API 
  - You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
  - You should change the look of the page based on the data, maybe by changing the color of the background or by adding images that describe the weather. (You could even use the Giphy API to find appropriate weather-related gifs and display them).
  -  Feel free to use promises or async/await in your code, though you should try to become comfortable with both.
